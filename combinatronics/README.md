# Fib Numbers
## Zeckendorfs Theorem
- Every positive integer can be written in a unique way as a sum of one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers such that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
- For any given positive integer, a representation that satisfies Zeckendorfâ€™s theorem can be found by using a Greedy algorithm: Choose the largest possible Fibonacci number ateach step. For example: 100 = 89 + 8 + 3; 77 = 55 + 21 + 1, 18 = 13 + 5, etc

## Pisano Period
- the last one/last two/last three/last fourdigit(s) of a Fibonacci number repeats with a period of 60/300/1500/15000 respectively.
